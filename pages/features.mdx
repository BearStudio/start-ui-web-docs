This page presents the features included in StartUI that can assist you in your development,
right from the project setup.

## User facing app

StartUI includes a "user facing" part, which aims to provide an interface usable by the end-users
of your application.

### Sign Up

The user sign-up functionality is already developed, using a password-less method.
The user enters their email and receives a validation code via email, which they can enter
in the provided field.

import accountCreationDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/account-management/account-creation-desktop.png";
import accountCreationMobileImage from "@/screenshots/account-management/account-creation-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs desktop={accountCreationDesktopImage} mobile={accountCreationMobileImage} />

### Sign In

Just like for account creation, the screens and mechanisms for signing in are natively developed in StartUI.
Thus, users can enter their email address and receive a code that allows them to log in, avoiding
the frustration of forgotten passwords.

### Account management

Allowing users to manage their account, being a common feature in any application, the screens
are also present, allowing the update of their name, default language, email, and more.

import accountManagementDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/account-management/account-management-desktop.png";
import accountManagementMobileImage from "@/screenshots/account-management/account-management-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs desktop={accountManagementDesktopImage} mobile={accountManagementMobileImage} />


## Admin app

The starter also includes an Administration part, which aims at providing a kind of backoffice to the platform admin.
### User management

From the project's creation, the administrator can manage the user list through a paginated interface, with the
ability to activate/deactivate a user, edit their information, view their details, and change their permissions.

import userManagementDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/admin-users-management/user-management-desktop.png";
import userManagementMobileImage from "@/screenshots/admin-users-management/user-management-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs desktop={userManagementDesktopImage} mobile={userManagementMobileImage} />


### CRUD sample

With the aim of accelerating development, an example of managing a basic entity has been implemented
in the "Repository" section. This example demonstrates how to perform a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
process, from front-end to back-end (including the database).

## Developer tools

We believe the core value of StartUI lies in its foundation and the technologies integrated into the starter kit.
Repeatedly setting up these technologies in every new project is a waste of time, so StartUI incorporates these
technologies and tools in their latest versions.

### Database management

With Prisma as one of the integrated technologies in the starter, it's possible to manage data using the ORM, and
benefit from developer tools like [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), the data browsing interface.

### Custom components

StartUI integrates default components, such as DataList, ConfirmMenuItem, or DayPicker. These components
once again accelerate development. They can be viewed in the [Storybook](https://demo.start-ui.com/storybook/),
which helps document and demonstrate their usage.

### Responsive

The user interfaces of StartUI are responsive by default.

import Image from "next/image";
import accountLogoutMobile from "@/screenshots/account-management/account-management-logout-mobile.png";
import repositoriesMobile from "@/screenshots/repositories-mobile.png";
import {ResponsiveStack} from "../components/ResponsiveStack";

<ResponsiveStack gap={2}>
    <Image
        src={accountLogoutMobile}
        style={{
            maxHeight: 500,
            objectFit: "contain",
            objectPosition: "0 0",
        }}
        placeholder="blur"
    />
    <Image
        src={repositoriesMobile}
        style={{
            maxHeight: 500,
            objectFit: "contain",
            objectPosition: "0 0",
        }}
        placeholder="blur"
    />
    <Image
        src={accountCreationMobileImage}
        style={{
            maxHeight: 500,
            objectFit: "contain",
            objectPosition: "0 0",
        }}
        placeholder="blur"
    />
</ResponsiveStack>

### Theming

With ChakraUI integrated into the starter, customizing the application's theme is straightforward,
including changing colors, spacing, font sizes, etc.

### Dark Mode

Dark Mode functionality is available by default, with the project's foundation designed to easily
implement this feature.

import userManagementMobileDarkmode from "@/screenshots/admin-users-management/user-management-mobile-darkmode.png";
import userManagementDesktopDarkmode from "@/screenshots/admin-users-management/user-management-desktop-darkmode.png";

<ImageTabs desktop={userManagementDesktopDarkmode} mobile={userManagementMobileDarkmode} />

### API documentation

An [API documentation](https://demo.start-ui.com/admin/docs/api) is available in the admin interface
through OpenAPI and Stoplight, allowing you to view all API routes and test endpoint calls.

### Email templating

React Email enables StartUI to offer tools for developing email templates in real-time.

### Layout

StartUI by default integrates two layouts, allowing developers to start without having to work on
page arrangement, headers, etc.
