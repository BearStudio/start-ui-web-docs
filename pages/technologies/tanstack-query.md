# TanStack Query

[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) (formerly React Query) is a powerful tool
to do efficient data synchronization for React. No need of Redux
or another global state manager anymore. Usable with [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
[`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios), or [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request),
TanStack Query will do the work and is agnostic of the method you will use.
