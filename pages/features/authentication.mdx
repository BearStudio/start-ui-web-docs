# Authentication

Authentication features are needed on almost every project, and developing them right takes time.
StartUI contains all the necessary screens to manage a complete authentication flow.
If you're using a JHipster backend, you don't have anything to do to have it work with your authentication system,
however if you're using another system, don't forget to connect the UI to it.

## Sign-up

The sign-up page can be found on the `app/account/register` route.  
Like every other page, it's translated.  
It contains a form with four fields:

- **Language** which is a Select component that will help the user choosing his preferred language, so that you can later display an
  adapted UI. You can check the (translation)[TODO] feature page to know more about this.
  The available values come from a constant containing the list of available languages along with their configuration (ltr, specific font size and so on).
- **Username** which could be a unique user identifier (it's up to you and your authentication system). This field is validated
  to respect a pattern and length.
- **Email** which is also validated using the Formiz email's validation pattern
- **Password** which is validated to be not too short and not too long

import { ImageTabs } from "@/components/ImageTabs";
import signUpDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/register-desktop.png";
import signUpMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/register-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Sign-up page screenshot on desktop",
    src: signUpDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Sign-up page screenshot on mobile",
    src: signUpMobileImage,
  }}
/>

Once the user registered, a success message is displayed asking them to check their emails.

import signUpSuccessDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/register-success-desktop.png";
import signUpSuccessMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/register-success-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Sign-up success message screenshot on desktop",
    src: signUpSuccessDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Sign-up success message screenshot on mobile",
    src: signUpSuccessMobileImage,
  }}
/>

## Login

The login page can be found on the `app/account/login` route.  
Like every other page, it's translated.  
It contains a form with an email and a password field, which are both required. Error messages are already managed for you
when login succeeds or fails.

import loginDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/login-desktop.png";
import loginMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/login-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Login page screenshot on desktop",
    src: loginDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Login page screenshot on mobile",
    src: loginMobileImage,
  }}
/>

## Reset password flow

The reset password flow is a standard flow that contains two steps.

### Ask for a reset password link

The first step consists in asking to get a reset password link which will be sent by email. This is done on the
`app/account/reset` route.
To do it, there's a page, accessible from the login page, which contains an email field. Starting to that point, there
are two scenario :
Either the email is known by your backend, then a success message with the next step's instructions is ready to be shown,
or the email isn't known and an error message is already implemented for you to use it.

import askResetPasswordDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/ask-reset-password-desktop.png";
import askResetPasswordMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/ask-reset-password-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Password reset link ask form screenshot on desktop",
    src: askResetPasswordDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Password reset link ask form screenshot on mobile",
    src: askResetPasswordMobileImage,
  }}
/>

### Reset the password

The second step consists in resetting the password, once the email's link has been clicked, which leads to the
`app/account/reset/finish` route.  
This page contains one password and one password confirm fields which are both validated to match each other.

import resetPasswordDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/reset-password-desktop.png";
import resetPasswordMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/reset-password-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Reset password form screenshot on desktop",
    src: resetPasswordDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Reset password form screenshot on mobile",
    src: resetPasswordMobileImage,
  }}
/>

## Session's expiration

Since it's part of any app requirements, we also handle the session's expiration in Start UI.  
To do so, we created an **interceptor** that will allow to trigger some code when an Unauthorized error (401) is
answered by the API. The triggered code will then open a modal asking the user to log in again, which leads to a better
UX than redirecting the user to the login page, or just prompting an error.

This piece of code is handled in the `src/spa/auth/LoginModalInterceptor.tsx` component.

import authModalDesktopImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/login-modal-interceptor-desktop.png";
import authModalMobileImage from "@/screenshots/authentication/login-modal-interceptor-mobile.png";

<ImageTabs
  desktop={{
    alt: "Authentication modal on desktop",
    src: authModalDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{
    alt: "Authentication modal on mobile",
    src: authModalMobileImage,
  }}
/>
