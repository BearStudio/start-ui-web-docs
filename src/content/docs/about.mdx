Start UI is a set of three projects that was initiated by the [BearStudio](https://bearstudio.fr) Team
and in particular by [Ivan Dalmet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ivandalmet).
The purpose of those projects is to make it easier and faster to reach the business features development time on a new project,
that is to say, stop wasting time putting together the standard technologies and tooling, and having a starter for it.

Here are the three projects:
 - [[web]](https://github.com/bearstudio/start-ui-web), which is the web starter related to this documentation
 - [[native]](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-native), which is a React Native starter that basically does the same
as the web starter but for mobile applications made with React Native.
 - [[figma]](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1025698982013308087), which is a Figma template that contains the same components
as the web starter, which will allow you to create mockups with the components you'll find in the web starter.
